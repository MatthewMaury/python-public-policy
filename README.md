# Python for Public Policy

[![Execute notebooks](https://github.com/afeld/python-public-policy/workflows/Execute%20notebooks/badge.svg)](https://github.com/afeld/python-public-policy/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Execute+notebooks%22+branch%main)

**Alternate course title:** _How to Use a Bit of Code to Do Things That Would Be Really Hard in Spreadsheets_

This repository contains content for [NYU Wagner's Python Coding for Public Policy](https://wagner.nyu.edu/education/courses/python-coding-for-public-policy) class (PADM-GP 4506).

- [Syllabus](syllabus.md#readme)
- [NYU Classes site](https://newclasses.nyu.edu/portal/site/a1020c0b-d7ec-4306-b6cf-20ee94470436), which students will use for:
  - Viewing Announcements
  - Submitting Assignments
  - Viewing grades
  - Viewing class recordings

Produced and taught by Aidan Feldman. Largely based on [previous iteration by Hannah Kates](https://github.com/hannahkates/python-public-policy).

## Why this class?

There are countless resources out there to learn Python and pandas — books, videos, etc. — and many are free. Relative to other Python/pandas courses, this class:

- Doesn't expect any prior technical experience
- Puts the data/code in a public policy context
  - There's a specific emphasis on learning coding for data analysis rather than software engineering
- Teaches you how to work with open data
- Optimizes for minimal setup

All the lectures and assignment templates are in this repository, so you _could_ go through them on your own. The benefits of enrolling are:

- Additional content
  - You get access to lectures (and their recordings), which includes commentary that isn't in this repository
  - You get access to assignment solutions
- Support
  - There is an instructor to answer questions, both during and between lectures
  - You have peers you can work with
- You invest money and are expected to show up to class and turn in assignments on time, which [makes it far more likely you will complete it](https://mashable.com/2014/12/16/warning-college-may-be-a-waste-of-your-time-and-money/#8BFB_sdkMaqy)

## Assignments

### Tips

- **Copy to Drive** when you start with one of the homework templates. This ensures your changes are saved.
- **Look at the Table of Contents** to get an overview. You can find the Table of Contents button at the top of the sidebar.
- **Read the instructions carefully.** Like word problems from math class, they are very specific in what they are asking for.
- **Spot check your results.** If you are transforming data from a previous Step, compare the results, do a handful of the calculations manually, etc. to ensure that the results are correct.
- **[Don't repeat yourself (DRY).](https://dzone.com/articles/is-your-code-dry-or-wet)** If you find yourself copying and pasting code within a notebook, there's probably a better way to do it.

### Turning in assignments

1. Ensure all the outputs are visible and the notebook is cleaned up
   - What you see is what the instructors will see.
1. Share the notebook
   1. [Share the file](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2494822) with alf9@nyu.edu and asu227@nyu.edu
   1. Change the permissions to `Commenter`
   1. Click `Copy link`
1. Go to [the list of Assignments in NYU Classes](https://newclasses.nyu.edu/portal/site/a1020c0b-d7ec-4306-b6cf-20ee94470436/tool/24429dd2-0b4f-489e-8e7e-63549448e73e)
1. Click that Assignment
1. Paste the link
1. Click `Submit`

After the resubmission deadline passes for each Assignment, you'll be able to find the Model Answer (a.k.a. the solution) in NYU Classes under the Assignments.

Note: In-class exercises will not be graded.

## Learning more

Want to keep going after this class?

### Python fundamentals

Recommended focusing on fundamentals of Python 3. Many "learn Python" resources will be web development-oriented (they will probably mention [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)/[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)), so you might want to look for ones that focus on data science or Python 3 on its own. Some that are data-oriented:

- DataCamp's [Python Fundamentals](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/python-fundamentals) or [Python Programmer](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/python-programmer) tracks
- [Kaggle's Learn Python tutorials](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)

Countless other "learn Python" resources/courses/videos/books out there; there isn't one right choice for everyone.

### Machine learning

- [Kaggle's Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)
- [Disco's machine learning content](https://www.heydisco.com/)
- [DataCamp's Natural Language Processing in Python track](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/natural-language-processing-in-python)
