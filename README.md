[![Execute notebooks](https://github.com/afeld/python-public-policy/workflows/Execute%20notebooks/badge.svg)](https://github.com/afeld/python-public-policy/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Execute+notebooks%22+branch%3Amaster)

**Alternate course title:** _How to Use a Bit of Code to Do Things That Would Be Really Hard in Spreadsheets_

This repository contains content for [NYU Wagner's Python Coding for Public Policy](https://wagner.nyu.edu/education/courses/python-coding-for-public-policy) class (PADM-GP 4506).

- [Syllabus](syllabus.md#readme)
- [NYU Classes site](https://newclasses.nyu.edu/portal/site/c07b0a52-cea7-453b-8198-4b59fdeb32f0), which students will use for:
  - Viewing Announcements
  - Submitting Assignments
  - Viewing grades
  - Viewing class recordings

Produced and taught by Aidan Feldman. Largely based on [previous iteration by Hannah Kates](https://github.com/hannahkates/python-public-policy).

## Assignments

### Tips

- **Copy to Drive** when you start with one of the homework templates. This ensures your changes are saved.
- **Look at the Table of Contents** to get an overview. You can find the Table of Contents button at the top of the sidebar.
- **Read the instructions carefully.** Like word problems from math class, they are very specific in what they are asking for.
- **Spot check your results.** If you are transforming data from a previous Step, compare the results, do a handful of the calculations manually, etc. to ensure that the results are correct.
- **[Don't repeat yourself (DRY).](https://dzone.com/articles/is-your-code-dry-or-wet)** If you find yourself copying and pasting code within a notebook, there's probably a better way to do it.
