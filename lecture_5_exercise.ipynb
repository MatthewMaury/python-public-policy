As I have read the pending rules, only a properly trained service dog would fulfill the criteria to accompany a passenger with special needs in the cabin. The wide and random acceptance of  non-professional trained emotional support animals in the cabin of aircraft would cease. This is essential for the health and safety of the passengers at large as well as the hard working crew. I hope to see this change made very soon. Thank you.</td>\n",

       "      <td>RE:  DOCKET NUMBER DOT-OST-2018-0068I am a psychotherapist who has worked with many people with PTSD and Severe panic attacks.  I have spoken with men whose PTSD, from serving in the military, has been so severe that they cannot go anywhere without their emotional support animals.  I have also treated people who have such bad  panic attacks that they become paralyzed or sometimes even faint.I implore you to not take away the privilege of these people having their ESAs on planes, to provide necessary comfort.  Just because you cannot see a disorder, doesn't mean  it doesn't exist.  I liken it to a domestic violence survivor who was emotionally abused.  His or her pain can be just as great as one who was physically abused.You will be doing a  tremendous disservice to people who legitimately need their ESAs, if you don't let these people travelwith them.  How can passengers prove that the service their ESAs serve is to help them feel safe? This is not an observerable task.Clearly people have abused this policy and that couldn't be more wrong.  However, there must be a better solution than what the DOT is proposing.  Some airlines are having passengers sign waivers that their pets are well-trained.  Can't that be enough?  Also, can't the proposal just consider allowing people with just dogs and cats as ESAs?Please consider what I have said.  If this rule is instituted, many people's lives will be severely negatively affected.Thank you.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I really appreciate the time that has been spent to really create a workable definition for what should reasonably considered a service animal. I would like to take the time to comment as a frequent passenger of airlines, as my experience is limited to that specifically on the call for comment on restriction by breed. Cabin spaces can be incredibly confined and the presence of a dog that exhibits characteristics of Bully breeds might initially suggest that these dogs should be prohibited. However I would like to offer two counterpoints (1) Bully breeds vary in size and (2) Significant accommodation and allowance are made for large bags As in all breeds there is significant variance of size. While what some would consider pit bulls can be as large as boxers there are others that due to their mixed background are much smaller than a golden retriever or German shepherd which might be considered the poster dogs for service animals. Simply restricting on the basis of appearance of Bully breeding, is close but not sufficient as a workable definition and places legitimate service animals and their handlers at risk. Second, from a narrative standpoint, as a student I have consistently observed the large backpacks taken by students onto planes at the beginning or end of breaks. These bags stuffed with books, computers, and supplies are often too large to fit underneath the slightly smaller spaces allotted for the aisle and window seats. In my own experience, I have only known legitimate service dogs to sit in the front row where they have space to lay or in a separate reserved seat.  Given the tolerance we understandably extend to college students at the holidays, I think it would not be unreasonable to extend similar patience towards dogs that significantly improve and aid their handler's successful maneuvering through society.</td>\n",

As I have read the pending rules, only a properly trained service dog would fulfill the criteria to accompany a passenger with special needs in the cabin. The wide and random acceptance of  non-professional trained emotional support animals in the cabin of aircraft would cease. This is essential for the health and safety of the passengers at large as well as the hard working crew. I hope to see this change made very soon. Thank you.   \n",

I have spoken with men whose PTSD, from serving in the military, has been so severe that they cannot go anywhere without their emotional support animals.  I have also treated people who have such bad  panic attacks that they become paralyzed or sometimes even faint.I implore you to not take away the privilege of these people having their ESAs on planes, to provide necessary comfort.  Just because you cannot see a disorder, doesn't mean  it doesn't exist.  I liken it to a domestic violence survivor who was emotionally abused.  His or her pain can be just as great as one who was physically abused.You will be doing a  tremendous disservice to people who legitimately need their ESAs, if you don't let these people travelwith them.  How can passengers prove that the service their ESAs serve is to help them feel safe? This is not an observerable task.Clearly people have abused this policy and that couldn't be more wrong.  However, there must be a better solution than what the DOT is proposing.  Some airlines are having passengers sign waivers that their pets are well-trained.  Can't that be enough?  Also, can't the proposal just consider allowing people with just dogs and cats as ESAs?Please consider what I have said.  If this rule is instituted, many people's lives will be severely negatively affected.Thank you.  \n",
       "4    I really appreciate the time that has been spent to really create a workable definition for what should reasonably considered a service animal. I would like to take the time to comment as a frequent passenger of airlines, as my experience is limited to that specifically on the call for comment on restriction by breed. Cabin spaces can be incredibly confined and the presence of a dog that exhibits characteristics of Bully breeds might initially suggest that these dogs should be prohibited. However I would like to offer two counterpoints (1) Bully breeds vary in size and (2) Significant accommodation and allowance are made for large bags As in all breeds there is significant variance of size. While what some would consider pit bulls can be as large as boxers there are others that due to their mixed background are much smaller than a golden retriever or German shepherd which might be considered the poster dogs for service animals. Simply restricting on the basis of appearance of Bully breeding, is close but not sufficient as a workable definition and places legitimate service animals and their handlers at risk. Second, from a narrative standpoint, as a student I have consistently observed the large backpacks taken by students onto planes at the beginning or end of breaks. These bags stuffed with books, computers, and supplies are often too large to fit underneath the slightly smaller spaces allotted for the aisle and window seats. In my own experience, I have only known legitimate service dogs to sit in the front row where they have space to lay or in a separate reserved seat.  Given the tolerance we understandably extend to college students at the holidays, I think it would not be unreasonable to extend similar patience towards dogs that significantly improve and aid their handler's successful maneuvering through society.   \n",

Passengers claiming pets as emotional support animals threaten the safety and health of other passengers.  I was on a flight recently in which a unleashed dog was allowed to wander around the plane.  In addition to allergy problems for passengers, dogs can spread germs and bacteria.  Please ban all untrained emotional support animals.  \n",

Only dogs.  And even dogs should be severely restricted.  Emotional support animals should not be included.  The DOT should require a License of some type that those with service dogs must obtain.  It should require a statement from a medical professional re the need for the service dog and also a certificate showing training.I realize some people really need their service dog and of course am willing to make accomodations.  But other people have needs as well.  My wife is deathly afraid of dogs (even really small ones which I find amusing).  I am not afraid of dogs but I am severely allergic to dogs.  Planes are full of enough pathogens for all of us to worry about without having to worry about dog dander as well.  Thank you for your consideration.  \n",

This has been abused for way too long. Anyone can get a note from their vet and/or doctor saying that their poor pet is needed for emotional stability. Enough. Flying is for humans, not pets - at least not pets that share cabin seats. I would like it to be limited to only official & documented service dogs (not all animals). Enough with this attitude that my pet can go with me anywhere.  \n",

As I have read the pending rules, only a properly trained service dog would fulfill the criteria to accompany a passenger with special needs in the cabin. The wide and random acceptance of  non-professional trained emotional support animals in the cabin of aircraft would cease. This is essential for the health and safety of the passengers at large as well as the hard working crew. I hope to see this change made very soon. Thank you.</td>\n",

I have spoken with men whose PTSD, from serving in the military, has been so severe that they cannot go anywhere without their emotional support animals.  I have also treated people who have such bad  panic attacks that they become paralyzed or sometimes even faint.I implore you to not take away the privilege of these people having their ESAs on planes, to provide necessary comfort.  Just because you cannot see a disorder, doesn't mean  it doesn't exist.  I liken it to a domestic violence survivor who was emotionally abused.  His or her pain can be just as great as one who was physically abused.You will be doing a  tremendous disservice to people who legitimately need their ESAs, if you don't let these people travelwith them.  How can passengers prove that the service their ESAs serve is to help them feel safe? This is not an observerable task.Clearly people have abused this policy and that couldn't be more wrong.  However, there must be a better solution than what the DOT is proposing.  Some airlines are having passengers sign waivers that their pets are well-trained.  Can't that be enough?  Also, can't the proposal just consider allowing people with just dogs and cats as ESAs?Please consider what I have said.  If this rule is instituted, many people's lives will be severely negatively affected.Thank you.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I really appreciate the time that has been spent to really create a workable definition for what should reasonably considered a service animal. I would like to take the time to comment as a frequent passenger of airlines, as my experience is limited to that specifically on the call for comment on restriction by breed. Cabin spaces can be incredibly confined and the presence of a dog that exhibits characteristics of Bully breeds might initially suggest that these dogs should be prohibited. However I would like to offer two counterpoints (1) Bully breeds vary in size and (2) Significant accommodation and allowance are made for large bags As in all breeds there is significant variance of size. While what some would consider pit bulls can be as large as boxers there are others that due to their mixed background are much smaller than a golden retriever or German shepherd which might be considered the poster dogs for service animals. Simply restricting on the basis of appearance of Bully breeding, is close but not sufficient as a workable definition and places legitimate service animals and their handlers at risk. Second, from a narrative standpoint, as a student I have consistently observed the large backpacks taken by students onto planes at the beginning or end of breaks. These bags stuffed with books, computers, and supplies are often too large to fit underneath the slightly smaller spaces allotted for the aisle and window seats. In my own experience, I have only known legitimate service dogs to sit in the front row where they have space to lay or in a separate reserved seat.  Given the tolerance we understandably extend to college students at the holidays, I think it would not be unreasonable to extend similar patience towards dogs that significantly improve and aid their handler's successful maneuvering through society.</td>\n",

As I have read the pending rules, only a properly trained service dog would fulfill the criteria to accompany a passenger with special needs in the cabin. The wide and random acceptance of  non-professional trained emotional support animals in the cabin of aircraft would cease. This is essential for the health and safety of the passengers at large as well as the hard working crew. I hope to see this change made very soon. Thank you. \n",

I have spoken with men whose PTSD, from serving in the military, has been so severe that they cannot go anywhere without their emotional support animals.  I have also treated people who have such bad  panic attacks that they become paralyzed or sometimes even faint.I implore you to not take away the privilege of these people having their ESAs on planes, to provide necessary comfort.  Just because you cannot see a disorder, doesn't mean  it doesn't exist.  I liken it to a domestic violence survivor who was emotionally abused.  His or her pain can be just as great as one who was physically abused.You will be doing a  tremendous disservice to people who legitimately need their ESAs, if you don't let these people travelwith them.  How can passengers prove that the service their ESAs serve is to help them feel safe? This is not an observerable task.Clearly people have abused this policy and that couldn't be more wrong.  However, there must be a better solution than what the DOT is proposing.  Some airlines are having passengers sign waivers that their pets are well-trained.  Can't that be enough?  Also, can't the proposal just consider allowing people with just dogs and cats as ESAs?Please consider what I have said.  If this rule is instituted, many people's lives will be severely negatively affected.Thank you.\n",
       "4    I really appreciate the time that has been spent to really create a workable definition for what should reasonably considered a service animal. I would like to take the time to comment as a frequent passenger of airlines, as my experience is limited to that specifically on the call for comment on restriction by breed. Cabin spaces can be incredibly confined and the presence of a dog that exhibits characteristics of Bully breeds might initially suggest that these dogs should be prohibited. However I would like to offer two counterpoints (1) Bully breeds vary in size and (2) Significant accommodation and allowance are made for large bags As in all breeds there is significant variance of size. While what some would consider pit bulls can be as large as boxers there are others that due to their mixed background are much smaller than a golden retriever or German shepherd which might be considered the poster dogs for service animals. Simply restricting on the basis of appearance of Bully breeding, is close but not sufficient as a workable definition and places legitimate service animals and their handlers at risk. Second, from a narrative standpoint, as a student I have consistently observed the large backpacks taken by students onto planes at the beginning or end of breaks. These bags stuffed with books, computers, and supplies are often too large to fit underneath the slightly smaller spaces allotted for the aisle and window seats. In my own experience, I have only known legitimate service dogs to sit in the front row where they have space to lay or in a separate reserved seat.  Given the tolerance we understandably extend to college students at the holidays, I think it would not be unreasonable to extend similar patience towards dogs that significantly improve and aid their handler's successful maneuvering through society. \n",

Passengers claiming pets as emotional support animals threaten the safety and health of other passengers.  I was on a flight recently in which a unleashed dog was allowed to wander around the plane.  In addition to allergy problems for passengers, dogs can spread germs and bacteria.  Please ban all untrained emotional support animals.\n",

Only dogs.  And even dogs should be severely restricted.  Emotional support animals should not be included.  The DOT should require a License of some type that those with service dogs must obtain.  It should require a statement from a medical professional re the need for the service dog and also a certificate showing training.I realize some people really need their service dog and of course am willing to make accomodations.  But other people have needs as well.  My wife is deathly afraid of dogs (even really small ones which I find amusing).  I am not afraid of dogs but I am severely allergic to dogs.  Planes are full of enough pathogens for all of us to worry about without having to worry about dog dander as well.  Thank you for your consideration.\n",

This has been abused for way too long. Anyone can get a note from their vet and/or doctor saying that their poor pet is needed for emotional stability. Enough. Flying is for humans, not pets - at least not pets that share cabin seats. I would like it to be limited to only official & documented service dogs (not all animals). Enough with this attitude that my pet can go with me anywhere.\n",

Furthermore, when I worked as a Customer Service Agent for my same airline prior to becoming a Flight Attendant, I saw many documents claiming an animal was needed as an Emotional Support Animal. Many of these documents were fake. All it takes is a simple google search to find out that it came from the internet or that it was not a real doctor who wrote it. There currently is no punishment for this forgery and it has completely gotten out of control and must be stopped. As far as I am concerned, the vast majority of those flying with Emotional Support Animals are doing so under false pretenses. They are passengers that simply want to travel with their pet. I understand people want to do this, but in its current form the law is a danger to not only myself, but to everyone that travels on an air carrier in the United States.</td>\n",

I also acknowledge the trouble fake service animals have been causing the airlines and general public. I ask that the airlines not allow negative experiences with fake services animals to cause them to treat travelers with legitament services animals less than or unfairly due to negative experiences with fake service animals. I support the proposed definition of a Service Animal:as a dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks forthe benefit of a qualified individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability since this proposeddefinition of a service animal is similar to the DOJ and ADA) definition of a service animal. I support permitting airlines to consider Emotional Support Animals as pets.In regards to species restrictions,I support permitting airlines to reject exotic animals. However, there should be exceptions for miniature horses as they are used as guides for some individuals with visual impairments. I only support the U.S. Department of Transportation Service Animal Air Transportation Health Form if it can be completed by a veterinarian and kept on file with the airlines for one year. This would remove the burden of a person traveling with a service animal from needing to do this everytime he/she flies. I oppose requiring the completion of the U.S. Department of Transportation Service Animal Air TransportationBehavior and Training Attestation Form and the U.S. Departmentof Transportation Service Animal Relief Attestation. I understand the growing issue of fake service animals and its negative impact on the public and on persons with disabilities who have legitament services animals. However, requiring these documents punishes persons with real service animals and does not prevent fake service animals from flying. I oppose the requirement that allows airlines to force all passengers with a disability traveling with a service animal to checkin one-hour before the check-in time for the general public as a condition for travel with a service animal. This is an additional inconvenience to the traveler with a service animal. I oppose the proposed Number of Service Animals Per Passenger,because a person with a service animal should only require one service animal.I support allowing airlines to ask the proposed questions in order to determine if the animal qualifies as a service animal: airlines are permitted to ask passengers with disabilities if the animalis required to accompany the passenger because of a disability, and what work or task the animal has been trained to perform, but the airline must notask the passenger the nature of his or her disability, nor are airlines permitted to ask service animals to demonstrate the work or tasks they have beentrained to perform.These questions are aligned with the ADA. I oppose the restrictions on large Service Animals.Even without a service animal, aircrafts are increasingly becoming smaller to accommodate more passengers. Often, it is necessary for a person with a service animal to sit in the baulk head area or toward the front of the plane. Airlines should be required to make special seating accommodations due to the size of the aircraft. This may include switching seats with another passenger. I support the proposal concerning the control of the animal: all service animals should be harnessed, leashed, tethered or otherwiseunder the control of its handler at all times in the airport and on the aircraft.I support the proposed continuation of the rule regarding Direct Threat.I support the proposal in regards to breed restrictions:airlines should not be allowed to impose breed and other categorical restrictions on service animals.</td>\n",

Not only because i worry about her but when I am away from her my anxiety really starts getting worse where my heart races every time I am driving away from my home where she watches me leave from my window. She is the calmest cat I have ever met or owned. Right when I saw her, she acknowledged me and was staring at my eyes right back. That is when i knew two things. She had green eyes like me, and there was a deeper spiritual, emotional, and therefore mental connection between us. She was this small malnourished kitten When I rescued her from the back of a crowded kennel and when I held her she immediately started purring and looked at me like she was so thankful of me to hold her although I could tell she was scared as it was our first meeting. Ever since, she stares at my eyes and its like I can tell what shes thinking. I have depression as well and when I am down, she comes to me and rubs my leg to get my attention off what my mind is telling me. She has allowed me to release a lot of tension, stress, and anger as well just by allowing me to pet her. She follows me around the house when I get home and plays with our dog to keep him company. She doesn't eat much when I am not around. I cant just leave her behind when I travel with my partner. She even has a harness to go on walks. She is only a year old.</td>\n",

People who falsely claim their pet is an emotional support animal are putting the safety of everyone around them at risk.  If people weren't abusing the system I do not think that this proposed rule would even exist.  My solution to this problem is as follows:1.No longer accept paperwork from online medical professionals.  Many people who abuse the system resort to online websites where you essentially pay for the paperwork.  As I was perusing comments someone had even posted their own letter form their doctor.  When I went to the listed website it seemed like it was one of those online places (divanmed.com).  2.Medical professionals should not be able to hand out the paperwork to anyone who wants their pet to be an emotional support animal.  A patient must show other attempts at getting help before receiving proper paperwork.  This could mean seeing a therapist multiple times - this way they can better assess whether an ESA is necessary for you.  While there are many details of my solution to be worked out, the main idea is that no one should be able to just get the paperwork when they want it.  A real need or attempt to get help should be shown first.</td>\n",

Having to do it for somebody who is disabled (me, for example) may be difficult for reasons of medicine, appointments, pain, or energy. Personally I know that every hour is precious.Documentation that isn't needed for any other thing in the world added on top of all the other difficulties of traveling is now another barrier to travel for a disabled person.Basically, this is just another way of keeping disabled people from flying.

Please get rid of the regulation requiring airlines to allow ESA for free. Everyone wishing to travel with an ESA should have to pay the standard Pet Fee!</td>\n",

       "      <td>I am surprised that dogs are allowed on flights at all. What would happen in the event of a major emergency such as smoke in the cabin, or an evacuation down the slides? Does the FAA have any data on what happens in these situations? Animals that cannot understand instructions from the cabin crew, and are likely to panic when the humans around them are panicking, are a recipe for disaster. I recommend that dogs be only allowed on flights if they are seeing eye dogs flying with the blind owner.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I have recently traveled a lot in the U.S. and I was thinking  that airports are beginning to look like the humane society.  Just because people wish to take their pets on trips does not mean they should be allowed.  The dogs I have witnessed show more anxiety traveling than their respective owners.  These are not service dogs but simply pets.  They are not \"comfort animals\" either!  Some people just cant leave their pets at home.  Can you imagine making an emergency stop due to an allergic reaction to pets?  What a nightmare.  My last flight had 2 dogs on it.  I was appalled.  So glad that you are considering steps to eliminate. Thank you for this opportunity to respond!With the concern for peanut allergies you should also consider animal hair.  Not many people realize they are allergic. Animals should not be allowed to touch the surface of any part of the cabin in an aircraft!</td>\n",

I have seen them break loose in the cabin, defecate on the planes, and even injure or attempt to injure myself and other passengers. I am strongly in support of banning Emotional Support Animals in full. No other country allows Emotional Support Animals on an aircraft. Furthermore, when I worked as a Customer Service Agent for my same airline prior to becoming a Flight Attendant, I saw many documents claiming an animal was needed as an Emotional Support Animal. Many of these documents were fake. All it takes is a simple google search to find out that it came from the internet or that it was not a real doctor who wrote it. There currently is no punishment for this forgery and it has completely gotten out of control and must be stopped. As far as I am concerned, the vast majority of those flying with Emotional Support Animals are doing so under false pretenses. They are passengers that simply want to travel with their pet. I understand people want to do this, but in its current form the law is a danger to not only myself, but to everyone that travels on an air carrier in the United States.  \n",
       "166  I am blind and require my Guide Dog for the Blind for my mobility and independence. It is important for my Guide Dog to be able to travel with me on an airplane without hassle. I also acknowledge the trouble fake service animals have been causing the airlines and general public. I ask that the airlines not allow negative experiences with fake services animals to cause them to treat travelers with legitament services animals less than or unfairly due to negative experiences with fake service animals. I support the proposed definition of a Service Animal:as a dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks forthe benefit of a qualified individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability since this proposeddefinition of a service animal is similar to the DOJ and ADA) definition of a service animal. I support permitting airlines to consider Emotional Support Animals as pets.In regards to species restrictions,I support permitting airlines to reject exotic animals. However, there should be exceptions for miniature horses as they are used as guides for some individuals with visual impairments. I only support the U.S. Department of Transportation Service Animal Air Transportation Health Form if it can be completed by a veterinarian and kept on file with the airlines for one year. This would remove the burden of a person traveling with a service animal from needing to do this everytime he/she flies. I oppose requiring the completion of the U.S. Department of Transportation Service Animal Air TransportationBehavior and Training Attestation Form and the U.S. Departmentof Transportation Service Animal Relief Attestation. I understand the growing issue of fake service animals and its negative impact on the public and on persons with disabilities who have legitament services animals. However, requiring these documents punishes persons with real service animals and does not prevent fake service animals from flying. I oppose the requirement that allows airlines to force all passengers with a disability traveling with a service animal to checkin one-hour before the check-in time for the general public as a condition for travel with a service animal. This is an additional inconvenience to the traveler with a service animal. I oppose the proposed Number of Service Animals Per Passenger,because a person with a service animal should only require one service animal.I support allowing airlines to ask the proposed questions in order to determine if the animal qualifies as a service animal: airlines are permitted to ask passengers with disabilities if the animalis required to accompany the passenger because of a disability, and what work or task the animal has been trained to perform, but the airline must notask the passenger the nature of his or her disability, nor are airlines permitted to ask service animals to demonstrate the work or tasks they have beentrained to perform.These questions are aligned with the ADA. I oppose the restrictions on large Service Animals.Even without a service animal, aircrafts are increasingly becoming smaller to accommodate more passengers. Often, it is necessary for a person with a service animal to sit in the baulk head area or toward the front of the plane. Airlines should be required to make special seating accommodations due to the size of the aircraft. This may include switching seats with another passenger. I support the proposal concerning the control of the animal: all service animals should be harnessed, leashed, tethered or otherwiseunder the control of its handler at all times in the airport and on the aircraft.I support the proposed continuation of the rule regarding Direct Threat.I support the proposal in regards to breed restrictions:airlines should not be allowed to impose breed and other categorical restrictions on service animals.  \n",

I won't leave her more than three days if I go anywhere for vacation. Not only because i worry about her but when I am away from her my anxiety really starts getting worse where my heart races every time I am driving away from my home where she watches me leave from my window. She is the calmest cat I have ever met or owned. Right when I saw her, she acknowledged me and was staring at my eyes right back. That is when i knew two things. She had green eyes like me, and there was a deeper spiritual, emotional, and therefore mental connection between us. She was this small malnourished kitten When I rescued her from the back of a crowded kennel and when I held her she immediately started purring and looked at me like she was so thankful of me to hold her although I could tell she was scared as it was our first meeting. Ever since, she stares at my eyes and its like I can tell what shes thinking. I have depression as well and when I am down, she comes to me and rubs my leg to get my attention off what my mind is telling me. She has allowed me to release a lot of tension, stress, and anger as well just by allowing me to pet her. She follows me around the house when I get home and plays with our dog to keep him company. She doesn't eat much when I am not around. I cant just leave her behind when I travel with my partner. She even has a harness to go on walks. She is only a year old.  \n",

People who falsely claim their pet is an emotional support animal are putting the safety of everyone around them at risk.  If people weren't abusing the system I do not think that this proposed rule would even exist.  My solution to this problem is as follows:1.No longer accept paperwork from online medical professionals.  Many people who abuse the system resort to online websites where you essentially pay for the paperwork.  As I was perusing comments someone had even posted their own letter form their doctor.  When I went to the listed website it seemed like it was one of those online places (divanmed.com).  2.Medical professionals should not be able to hand out the paperwork to anyone who wants their pet to be an emotional support animal.  A patient must show other attempts at getting help before receiving proper paperwork.  This could mean seeing a therapist multiple times - this way they can better assess whether an ESA is necessary for you.  While there are many details of my solution to be worked out, the main idea is that no one should be able to just get the paperwork when they want it.  A real need or attempt to get help should be shown first.    \n",

Comfort animals need to be left at home. I see them in restaurants and grocery stores in shopping carts. So gross to think about putting my groceries into a cart that a big dog had been in. Stop the nonsense, too many people with dumb demands at other peoples expense.  \n",

Allowed animals should be limited to those trained service dogs without which their owners could not travel, for instance, service dogs for the blind. It should not be overlooked that persons with pet allergies can suffer great harm from the presence of too many pets in an enclosed space.  \n",

I have seem these animals first hand defecate and urinate while on a flight or in an airport. I have heard owners of pets brag that they can bring their pet along for free now.  Please pass these new proposed rules.  \n",

However, requiring additional documentation from a veterenarian is expensive and overly burdensome to a population that is already dealing with a great deal of complications. This seems unnecessary and unfairl.  \n",

Therapy horses and large dogs sitting in the aisle?  Ridiculous and a clear safety hazard. I am all for the proposed tightening up of the regulations. We have reached the point of absurdity and hope there is some sanity before an accident shows that you cannot evacuate an airplane filled with animals  \n",

So many people abuse this system that people just started believing all ESA's are fake. My ESA knows several commands, behaves nicely in public and I follow the laws.   \n",

Instead of saying that airline carriers are like any other business in that service animals are allowed and ESAs are not, you're going through and putting all these other restrictions on things in hopes to weed out ESAs when all that will really do is stop disabled people on limited incomes, energy, and time from traveling anywhere by plane.As an example: Having to show up early is difficult for able-bodied people. Having to do it for somebody who is disabled (me, for example) may be difficult for reasons of medicine, appointments, pain, or energy. Personally I know that every hour is precious.Documentation that isn't needed for any other thing in the world added on top of all the other difficulties of traveling is now another barrier to travel for a disabled person.Basically, this is just another way of keeping disabled people from flying. Flight should simply be regulated like any other business. It would be the best way forward.  \n",

I have witnessed barking, biting, pooping from the animal itself.  The animal owners DO NOT follow the instructions of flight attendants nor the rules and regulations set forth by the airline.  I have  seen the animals with ticks and fleas as do the owners.  There are many people who are allergic to the animals either causing the other passengers to need an epi pen or the allergies cause inflammation of the ears, eyes, throat and nose.  These animals are a nuisance.  Pet carrier owners also do NOT adhere to the rules and regulations set forth by the airline.  \n",

However those of us who have been certified to bring a pet on board an aircraft do not deserve to be penalized because others have abused the privilege with unusual pets. My small dog has provided me with much comfort during illness and it would be very difficult for me to travel by other means of transportation.  Certapet has questioned me extensively as has a mental health physician.  I have passed all tests and have been relieved that I would be able to travel with my 22 pound golden doodle.  I would be grateful to submit to any other types of examination and I hope that the permission will still be available, though more stringent in the examination.Thank you for your kind attention:  Edith N Slotkin, Jupiter Florida  \n",

These are animals are not properly trained and can cause disruption and harm to other paying customers on the flight. If people can't fly without bringing a pig to cuddle on a flight, then they should stay home. Why does everyone else on board the flight have to be inconvenienced for one person? This is insanity and most times it's just a scam to get out of paying additional fare for their pets. Stop ESA now!  \n",

Animal owners are abusing the rules and system designed for truly needed service animals.  They have gone too far and this trend of allowing pets onto planes, into stores, restaurants, ball games, etc has gotten to be an epidemic.  Furthermore we are no longer dealing with service dogs, but expect to be tolerant of therapy horses, birds, pigs and others.  This is completely unreasonable and abusive. Air travel should be especially off limits to these supposed therapy animals because of the confined nature of the plane with no option for removal of the pet once in the air; the recirculating air (and in my case I am highly allergic to cat dander), and the physical nuisance which you cannot get away from.  Once again, let me be clear, I am in complete support of the airlines efforts to limit the allowable animals on board a flight. Thank you for your efforts to make this happen.  \n",

People will always try to find some way to game the system. This will hopefully prevent everyone having to go through another 2+ years process similar to what we are going through now.  \n",

It is unfair and ridiculous. Please get rid of the regulation requiring airlines to allow ESA for free. Everyone wishing to travel with an ESA should have to pay the standard Pet Fee!  \n",

What would happen in the event of a major emergency such as smoke in the cabin, or an evacuation down the slides? Does the FAA have any data on what happens in these situations? Animals that cannot understand instructions from the cabin crew, and are likely to panic when the humans around them are panicking, are a recipe for disaster. I recommend that dogs be only allowed on flights if they are seeing eye dogs flying with the blind owner.  \n",

Just because people wish to take their pets on trips does not mean they should be allowed.  The dogs I have witnessed show more anxiety traveling than their respective owners.  These are not service dogs but simply pets.  They are not \"comfort animals\" either!  Some people just cant leave their pets at home.  Can you imagine making an emergency stop due to an allergic reaction to pets?  What a nightmare.  My last flight had 2 dogs on it.  I was appalled.  So glad that you are considering steps to eliminate. Thank you for this opportunity to respond!With the concern for peanut allergies you should also consider animal hair.  Not many people realize they are allergic. Animals should not be allowed to touch the surface of any part of the cabin in an aircraft!  "

      "I am blind and require my Guide Dog for the Blind for my mobility and independence. It is important for my Guide Dog to be able to travel with me on an airplane without hassle. I also acknowledge the trouble fake service animals have been causing the airlines and general public. I ask that the airlines not allow negative experiences with fake services animals to cause them to treat travelers with legitament services animals less than or unfairly due to negative experiences with fake service animals. I support the proposed definition of a Service Animal:as a dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks forthe benefit of a qualified individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability since this proposeddefinition of a service animal is similar to the DOJ and ADA) definition of a service animal. I support permitting airlines to consider Emotional Support Animals as pets.In regards to species restrictions,I support permitting airlines to reject exotic animals. However, there should be exceptions for miniature horses as they are used as guides for some individuals with visual impairments. I only support the U.S. Department of Transportation Service Animal Air Transportation Health Form if it can be completed by a veterinarian and kept on file with the airlines for one year. This would remove the burden of a person traveling with a service animal from needing to do this everytime he/she flies. I oppose requiring the completion of the U.S. Department of Transportation Service Animal Air TransportationBehavior and Training Attestation Form and the U.S. Departmentof Transportation Service Animal Relief Attestation. I understand the growing issue of fake service animals and its negative impact on the public and on persons with disabilities who have legitament services animals. However, requiring these documents punishes persons with real service animals and does not prevent fake service animals from flying. I oppose the requirement that allows airlines to force all passengers with a disability traveling with a service animal to checkin one-hour before the check-in time for the general public as a condition for travel with a service animal. This is an additional inconvenience to the traveler with a service animal. I oppose the proposed Number of Service Animals Per Passenger,because a person with a service animal should only require one service animal.I support allowing airlines to ask the proposed questions in order to determine if the animal qualifies as a service animal: airlines are permitted to ask passengers with disabilities if the animalis required to accompany the passenger because of a disability, and what work or task the animal has been trained to perform, but the airline must notask the passenger the nature of his or her disability, nor are airlines permitted to ask service animals to demonstrate the work or tasks they have beentrained to perform.These questions are aligned with the ADA. I oppose the restrictions on large Service Animals.Even without a service animal, aircrafts are increasingly becoming smaller to accommodate more passengers. Often, it is necessary for a person with a service animal to sit in the baulk head area or toward the front of the plane. Airlines should be required to make special seating accommodations due to the size of the aircraft. This may include switching seats with another passenger. I support the proposal concerning the control of the animal: all service animals should be harnessed, leashed, tethered or otherwiseunder the control of its handler at all times in the airport and on the aircraft.I support the proposed continuation of the rule regarding Direct Threat.I support the proposal in regards to breed restrictions:airlines should not be allowed to impose breed and other categorical restrictions on service animals.\n"
