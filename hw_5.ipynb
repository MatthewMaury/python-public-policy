    "Homework 6, the final project, is open-ended: The goal is to prove or disprove a hypothesis using the skills learned in this class. In the real world, one would start with a specific question and find data to answer it, but the data needed often doesn't exist or is hard (or impossible) to find/access. The recommended, safer approach, for the purposes of this assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find a dataset that seems interesting.\n",
    "  - [NYC OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/), [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/), and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) have many many options.\n",
    "  - Finding a dataset available in CSV or Excel formats ([Pandas can also read the latter](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_excel.html)) is recommended.\n",
    "1. Look at the columns and some data in the dataset.\n",
    "1. Come up with a question that the data is capable of answering and _isn't trivial to answer_.\n",
    "  - If you aren't sure, ask.\n",
    "1. Come up with a hypothesis (a.k.a. a guess of the answer to the question).\n",

    "  - **Dataset:** [Recycling Diversion and Capture Rates](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Recycling-Diversion-and-Capture-Rates/gaq9-z3hz)\n",
    "  - **Question:** From 2016 to 2019, what community district increased their diversion (recycling) rate the most?\n",
    "  - **Hypothesis:** [Bushwick](https://communityprofiles.planning.nyc.gov/brooklyn/4), because it's gentrified over that time, and hipsters love to recycle.\n",
    "1. Create a new notebook to do the actual analysis; you will turn that in separately.\n",
    "1. Go back and find any information that's available _around_ the data, to get a better understanding of what it contains and means.\n",
    "  - This might include a data dictionary, and it might involve poking around a government agency's web site to understand their processes.\n",
